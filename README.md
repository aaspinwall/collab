## Mission
We aim to build a functional and well-presented web-based app, with an emphasis on maintaining a respectful, collaborative environment. Our group presents opportunities for members to learn and teach, whether in programming/tools or other parts of the project, such as organization and design. And most importantly... we want to have fun!

## Community guidelines
- Exercise mutual respect
- Everyone is invited to contribute, regardless of their level of experience – don’t be afraid to make mistakes and ask questions!
- You can commit to as much or as little work as you want – but please respect the time of your fellow teammates and honour commitments to the best of your ability
- Communication: Join our [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/collab-centre/shared_invite/zt-izqi8c7p-qzOXc48kkdQDXfpCPmtIZA)

Note: If you have a specific problem that does not involve everyone, don’t spam – create a separate slack channel or talk directly to the contributor.
