# Welcome to our Collab project!

![facebook_cover_photo_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17233773/99539534-5c878180-297c-11eb-8c14-dd1e10abaf0f.png)

## Mission

We aim to build a functional and well-presented web-based app, with an emphasis on maintaining a respectful, collaborative environment. Our group presents opportunities for members to learn and teach, whether in programming/tools or other parts of the project, such as organization and design. And most importantly... we want to have fun!

## Community guidelines

- Exercise mutual respect
- Everyone is invited to contribute, regardless of their level of experience – don’t be afraid to make mistakes and ask questions!
- You can commit to as much or as little work as you want – but please respect the time of your fellow teammates and honour commitments to the best of your ability
- Communication: Join our [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/collab-centre/shared_invite/zt-izqi8c7p-qzOXc48kkdQDXfpCPmtIZA)

Note: If you have a specific problem that does not involve everyone, don’t spam – create a separate slack channel or talk directly to the contributor.

## Contributing

Are you ready to start collaborating? Head to our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/1ujX8BDZ/collab) and pick up a task.

## Getting Started

**1. Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ShaiGilboa/collab.git collab

cd collab
```

**2. Install the dependencies and start the local server.**

On the command line, run:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Open your browser on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). This will take you to the homepage.

**3. Next time you want to open the app.**

On the command line, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## App structure

- frontend: Next.js app
- backend: GraphQL server

Each section of the app can be it's own separate unit, all things FE will be in the `frontend` and nothing but `frontend`,
and the same goes for the `backend` folder.

The main benefit I see for this is that I find in organized :) and if we decide to host each part on a different platform, it's easier because they are already separated
