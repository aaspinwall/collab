## Getting Started

**Important**: Make sure you duplicate the `env.sample` file and rename the copy `.env`

Since this repository is public, we don't want to share our API keys. Please go on the [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/collab-centre/shared_invite/zt-izqi8c7p-qzOXc48kkdQDXfpCPmtIZA) to get our keys. Alternatively, you can generate your own API keys and test everything using your own accounts.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You'll see a playground where each component will be isolated. Click on the **docs** tab to see what each control does. Each control translates to a prop going into the react component.

You can read more about Storybook on their [getting started guide](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).
